# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The JVM level was changed from '22' to '21' as the Kotlin version does not support Java 22 yet.
* The original package name 'com.shakirfattani.employee-management' is invalid and this project uses 'com.shakirfattani.employee_management' instead.
